Sulit Foods is a social enterprise that aims to reduce food waste, increase food accessibility, and reduce hunger by working closely with retail outlets, cafes, and farmers to strategically market on an app strategically, their leftover but still good food as well as imperfect fruits and vegetables that would otherwise have gone to waste.
Creating impact to communities one meal pack at a time.
